# Stupid Project 1: Ping Pong Mouse
Made a front-end infinite loop with two buttons.\
The left Button moves the mouse to click the 
right button and the right button moves the mouse
to click the left button
## Dependencies I used
* [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Mouse Control
* [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html): Graphic User Interface

## How to stop the program
Just move the mouse away from the GUI to interrupt the mouse-moving process.
